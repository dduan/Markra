## Promotional Text
Write plain-text JIRA in Markdown/CommanMark.

## Description

Author JIRA tickets in Markdown syntax. As you type, Markra will translate it to plain text Jira syntax. Post your ticket by simply copying/pasting the output.

Getting JIRA ticket in the right format is both tedious and hard. You either have to wrangle with the rich text editor on the web page, or get a precise outcome by authoring in JIRA's plain text syntax. Markra's author prefers the latter but never bothered memorizing JIRA's plain text syntax.

Markdown, on the other hand, is universal, and familiar to programmers.

Markra is for those who love Markdown, and wish they can create JIRA tickets in Markdown in a fast, simple native editor.

Edit or open a CommonMark file, your Jira ticket will appear alongside it in plaintext format. With a click of a button (or good old select-all-and-copy), your ticket is in clipboard and ready for posting. No need to learn or memorize JIRA's syntax. It's simple.
